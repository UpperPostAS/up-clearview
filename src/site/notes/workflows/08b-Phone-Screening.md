# Phone Screening

**Purpose:** Conduct initial phone screening with referral to verify basic eligibility and interest
**Status:** âœ… Complete
**Trigger:** User clicks "Phone Screening" button on RNAInfoScreen
**Data Sources:** Referrals & Applicants (updates)

## Overview

The Phone Screening workflow guides staff through an initial eligibility conversation with a new referral. This is typically the first substantive contact between Upper Post Clearview staff and the referred individual, occurring shortly after the referral is received from a community partner.

During the phone screening, staff verify basic information, confirm the individual's interest in the housing opportunity, conduct preliminary eligibility screening based on unit type requirements, and schedule an intake appointment if appropriate. This workflow helps filter referrals early in the process and ensures that staff time is focused on viable housing placements.

The screen provides quick access to unit type eligibility requirements so staff can reference them during the conversation. Upon completion, the referral status is typically updated to reflect the screening outcome (e.g., "Referral, Screened" or "Former Referral" if not eligible/interested).
