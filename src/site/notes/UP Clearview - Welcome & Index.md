**UP Clearview Documentation Hub**

---

## Welcome

UP Clearview is CommonBond Communities' operations hub for supportive housing. The app centralizes unit availability, referral and resident pipelines, service provider coordination, and Housing Support bill-pay so staff can keep people housed without jumping across spreadsheets. This hub is the single source of truth for project knowledge—start here to choose the guide you need.

### Current Project Status (October 24, 2025)

**Overall Completion: ~85%** — The core application is functional with most critical workflows operational. Exit logging is now fully implemented, creating archive records when residents or referrals leave the system. Testing has validated the referral close-out workflow and most screens are production-ready. Key remaining work includes completing the intake workflow form and integrating account provider creation into the associations interface.

**Ready for Trial & ETO Integration Planning:**
- Exit records (Exits list) now capture name, stage (Resident/Applicant/Referral), date, reason, and notes
- Referral receive workflow ready for data capture design discussions
- Consider what initial data points would facilitate ETO integration
