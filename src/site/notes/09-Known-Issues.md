## High Priority (Should Fix Before Deployment) ðŸŸ 

### ISSUE-003: OnSuccess Handlers Missing
**Components:** RNAInfoScreen, UnitInfoScreen
**Status:** Open
**Priority:** HIGH
**Estimated Fix:** 1-2 hours total

**Problem:**
Main forms on RNAInfoScreen and UnitInfoScreen (Form1) lack OnSuccess handlers. After users save edits, they receive no confirmation and data doesn't refresh automatically.

**Impact:**
- Poor user experience
- Users unsure if save succeeded
- Must manually refresh to see changes
- Could lead to duplicate edits

**Workaround:**
Forms do save correctly. Users can refresh the page or navigate away and back to see updates.

**Proposed Fix:**

For RNAInfoScreen:
```powerapps
Form1.OnSuccess: |-
  =Notify("Referral information updated successfully.", NotificationType.Success);
  Refresh('Referrals & Applicants');
  Set(varSelectedRNA, Form1.LastSubmit)
```

For UnitInfoScreen:
```powerapps
Form1.OnSuccess: |-
  =Notify("Unit information updated successfully.", NotificationType.Success);
  Refresh(Units);
  Set(varSelectedUnit, Form1.LastSubmit)
```

### ISSUE-004: Password Field Security Risk
**Component:** scrResidentAccounts, Account Information list
**Status:** Open
**Priority:** HIGH
**Estimated Fix:** 1-2 hours

**Problem:**
Account Information list stores passwords in plain text. This is a security vulnerability.

**Impact:**
- Passwords visible to anyone with SharePoint access
- Security compliance risk
- Data breach potential

**Workaround:**
Leave password field empty; use browser-based password managers.

**Proposed Fix:**
1. Remove Password field from Account Information list in SharePoint
2. Remove password data card from scrResidentAccounts form
3. Update documentation to recommend browser password managers
4. Communicate change to users

**Alternative Options:**
- Implement third-party password vault integration
- Build encrypted storage (complex, not recommended)

- [scrResidentAccounts](screens/07k-scrResidentAccounts.md)
- [Data Model](03-Data-Model.md#account-information)

### ISSUE-005: Convert to Resident Workflow Untested
**Component:** scrConvert
**Status:** Open (code complete, testing pending)
**Priority:** HIGH
**Estimated Fix:** 1-2 hours validation testing

**Problem:**
Convert to Resident workflow implementation is complete but has not been tested end-to-end with real data.

**Impact:**
- Unknown if all fields transfer correctly
- Lookup field handling unvalidated
- Unit update logic unconfirmed
- Could fail in production

**Workaround:**
N/A - workflow should not be used until validated.

**Testing Plan:**
1. Create complete test referral with all fields populated
2. Assign to specific unit
3. Set status to "Applicant, Approved"
4. Execute conversion
5. Verify all fields transferred to resident record
6. Verify lookup fields (Unit, Associated Providers) correct
7. Verify unit updated (occupant set, referral cleared)
8. Verify referral deleted
9. Verify navigation to correct resident detail screen
10. Check for any errors or data inconsistencies

## Medium Priority (UX Issues, Non-Blocking) ðŸŸ¡

### ISSUE-006: Service Provider Inline Creation Not Available
**Component:** scrResidentAssociations
**Status:** Open
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Estimated Fix:** 2-3 hours

**Problem:**
Cannot create new service providers from the scrResidentAssociations screen. Users can only select existing providers from a dropdown.

**Impact:**
- Poor user experience when new provider needs to be added
- Forces context switch to SharePoint or scrServiceProviders screen
- Slows down workflow

**Workaround:**
1. Go to SharePoint and create service provider directly, OR
2. Navigate to scrServiceProviders screen, create provider, then return

**Proposed Fix:**
Add modal form on scrResidentAssociations for creating new service providers:
1. Add "New Provider" button next to provider selection
2. Show modal with provider creation form
3. On save, add new provider to database
4. Refresh provider list
5. Auto-select newly created provider

**Problem:**
Phone screening section on RNAInfoScreen has some issues. Main functionality works but edge cases may have problems.

**Impact:**
- Unknown - needs specific documentation
- Main phone screening workflow appears functional

**Workaround:**
Use phone screening modal for primary workflow.

## Low Priority (Minor Issues) ðŸŸ¢

### ISSUE-008: Missing Comprehensive Test Suite
**Component:** All
**Status:** Open
**Priority:** LOW
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours

**Problem:**
No automated or comprehensive manual test suite exists. Testing is ad-hoc.

**Impact:**
- Regressions could be introduced without detection
- Difficult to validate changes
- Time-consuming to test before deployment

**Workaround:**
Manual testing of critical workflows before each release.

**Proposed Fix:**
1. Create comprehensive test plan document
2. Build test data set in SharePoint
3. Document test procedures for each screen
4. Document test procedures for each workflow
5. Create regression test checklist
6. Consider Power Apps Test Studio for automated tests
