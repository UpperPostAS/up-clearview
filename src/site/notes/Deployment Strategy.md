# Deployment Strategy

**Phased Rollout Plan for UP Clearview**
**Last Updated:** October 24, 2025

---

## Overview

UP Clearview will deploy in phases, starting with small pilot sites to gather feedback and refine the tool before broader rollout. After pilot success and professional UI development, the system will expand to all CommonBond supportive housing sites.

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Deployment (Current)

**Timeline:** Until critical tasks complete
**Estimated Effort:** 14-21 hours

### Objectives
- Complete all critical blockers
- Ensure core workflows functional
- Validate data integrity

### Tasks
See [[Critical Tasks\|Critical Tasks]] for complete breakdown:
1. Complete IntakeScreen form (6-8 hours)
2. Validate Convert to Resident workflow (1-2 hours)
3. Implement Household Members section (4-6 hours)
4. Add OnSuccess handlers (1-2 hours)
5. Resolve password management (1-2 hours)

### Completion Criteria
- [ ] All workflows operational (Phone Screening, Receive Referral, Intake, Convert, Close-Out, Exit)
- [ ] All 13 screens functional
- [ ] Critical data fields captured
- [ ] User feedback mechanisms in place (notifications)
- [ ] Security issues addressed (password management)

---

## Phase 2: Pilot Rollout

**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks after Phase 1 complete
**Participants:** 2-3 small sites, 6-10 units each, one coordinator per site

### Objectives
- Real-world validation of workflows
- Gather user feedback on functionality and usability
- Identify pain points and missing features
- Collect data on what additional fields/features are needed for ETO integration

### Pilot Site Selection Criteria

**Ideal Pilot Site:**
- 6-10 units (small enough for manageable testing)
- 1 dedicated coordinator (consistent user for feedback)
- Moderate turnover (1-2 moves per quarter - enough activity to test workflows)
- Tech-comfortable staff (willing to provide detailed feedback)
- Mix of unit types (LTH, CoC, or Section 8 to test different eligibility requirements)

**Example Pilot Sites:**
- Site A: 8 units, LTH Housing Support, 1 coordinator
- Site B: 6 units, Ramsey CoC, 1 coordinator
- Site C: 10 units, Mixed (LTH + Section 8), 1 coordinator

### Pilot Activities

**Week 1-2: Setup & Training**
- [ ] Export current site data to Excel
- [ ] Build SharePoint schema for each pilot site
- [ ] Import pilot site data (see [[UP Clearview - Implementation Guide#Data Collection and Migration Strategy\|UP Clearview - Implementation Guide#Data Collection and Migration Strategy]])
- [ ] Train coordinators (1-2 hour sessions)
- [ ] Provide quick reference guides

**Week 3-6: Active Use & Feedback Collection**
- [ ] Coordinators use UP Clearview for daily operations
- [ ] Weekly check-ins to discuss issues and suggestions
- [ ] Document pain points, missing features, desired changes
- [ ] Track: What workflows are used most? What's confusing? What's missing?
- [ ] Collect feedback on ETO integration needs: What data points should we capture in Receive Referral?

**Key Questions for Coordinators:**
1. Which workflows do you use most frequently?
2. What information is hard to find or enter?
3. What features would save you the most time?
4. Are there any data fields missing that you need?
5. How does this compare to your previous tracking method?
6. What would make this tool indispensable for you?

### Pilot Success Metrics

**Functional Metrics:**

## Phase 5: ETO Integration (Future)

**Timeline:** 3-6 months after full deployment
**Prerequisite:** Pilot feedback on data needs collected

### Objectives
- Integrate with CommonBond's ETO (Efforts to Outcomes) system
- Reduce duplicate data entry
- Streamline reporting

### Activities

- [ ] Build integration connectors (Power Automate flows or custom APIs)
- [ ] Test data synchronization
- [ ] Validate data integrity across systems
- [ ] Train users on integrated workflow

### Integration Scenarios
- **Scenario 1: One-way sync (UP Clearview â†’ ETO)**
  - Exit records automatically create case close-outs in ETO
  - Referral data syncs to ETO intake forms

- **Scenario 2: Two-way sync**
  - ETO referrals auto-create records in UP Clearview
  - UP Clearview updates sync back to ETO

- **Scenario 3: Export/Import**
  - Periodic data export from UP Clearview
  - Import to ETO using standard templates

### Considerations
- ETO API capabilities and limitations
- Data transformation requirements
- Frequency of sync (real-time, hourly, daily)
- Error handling and conflict resolution
- User permissions and security

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: User Resistance to Change
**Mitigation:**
- Involve coordinators early (pilot phase)
- Show clear benefits and time savings
- Provide excellent training and support
- Phased rollout allows adjustment

### Risk: Data Migration Issues
**Mitigation:**
- Use [[UP Clearview - Implementation Guide\|Implementation Guide]] best practices
- Test with 5-10 records before full import
- Keep source data files as backup
- Validate data after import

### Risk: Technical Issues During Rollout
**Mitigation:**
- Pilot phase identifies major issues before broad deployment
- Phased rollout limits impact if problems occur
- Support resources available during go-live
- Rollback plan to previous tracking method if needed

### Risk: Missing Features Identified After Deployment
**Mitigation:**
- Continuous feedback collection during pilot
- Agile development approach for quick enhancements
- Prioritized backlog for post-deployment improvements
- Regular update cycles

## Support Model

### During Rollout (Phases 2-4)
- **Dedicated support contact** available via phone/email/Teams
- **Response time:** Within 4 business hours for questions, within 1 business day for bugs
- **Office hours:** Weekly drop-in sessions for questions
