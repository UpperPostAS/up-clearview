# Current Status

**Last Updated:** October 24, 2025
**Version:** Final Development Session
**Overall Completion:** 85%

---

## Progress Overview

- **Core Functionality:** 90% complete (browse, view, edit, navigate all working well)
- **Workflows:** 80% complete (phone screening done, close-out done, convert to resident done, exit resident with logging done, intake form still needed)
- **Provider & Account Management:** 80% complete (basic CRUD working, inline provider creation from associations still pending)
- **Exit Logging:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (Exits list captures all resident and referral departures)

---

## What's Working Well

### Tested & Validated Screens
- ✅ **ResBrowseScreen** - Resident gallery, extensively tested
- ✅ **ResInfoScreen** - Resident details with working exit workflow
- ✅ **UnitBrowseScreen** - Unit gallery with vacancy filter (includes units with notice)
- ✅ **RNABrowseScreen** - Referrals & Applicants gallery
- ✅ **RNACloseScreen** - Referral close-out with exit logging, extensively tested

### Complete Workflows
- ✅ **Phone Screening** - Form functional, data saves correctly
- ✅ **Receive Referral** - Modal form on vacant units, ready for trial use
- ✅ **Close-Out (Referral/Applicant)** - Creates Exit record, parses stage, clears unit
- ✅ **Exit Resident** - Creates Exit record, updates unit, removes resident
- ✅ **Convert to Resident** - Implementation complete, needs validation testing

### Exit Logging System ✅ NEW
- **Exits List** fully operational
- Captures: Name, Stage (Resident/Applicant/Referral), Date, Reason, Notes
- Automatically populated by exit and close-out workflows
- Ready for ETO integration planning

---

## Known Issues

### Screen Issues
- ⚠️ **RNAInfoScreen** - Phone screening section has some issues (main functionality works)
- ⚠️ **IntakeScreen** - Displays eligibility but lacks data entry form (critical blocker)
- ⚠️ **scrResidentAssociations** - Cannot add service provider inline (must use SharePoint)

### Workflow Issues
- ⚠️ **scrConvert** - Not yet tested after recent implementation

---

## Ready for Trial Use

The following features are functional and ready for staff to begin using and providing feedback:

1. **Receive Referral Workflow** - Gather feedback on what data should be captured
2. **Exit Tracking** - Fully functional, ready for ETO integration planning
3. **Close-Out Workflow** - Extensively tested and operational
4. **Browse/View/Edit** - All three main views (Units, Residents, Referrals) working well

---

## Critical Blockers Before Deployment

1. **IntakeScreen form implementation** (6-8 hours)
2. **Convert to Resident validation testing** (1-2 hours)
3. **Household members/family associations** (4-6 hours)

See [[Critical Tasks\|Critical Tasks]] for detailed breakdown.

---

## Next Milestone: Pilot Rollout

After critical blockers are addressed, the recommended next step is:

**Small Site Pilot** (6-10 units each)
- 2-3 sites with one coordinator per site
- Coordinators interact with tool and provide feedback
- Gather real-world usage data and pain points
- Iterate based on feedback before broader rollout

See [[Deployment Strategy\|Deployment Strategy]] for full rollout plan.

After successful pilot and feedback incorporation, begin professional UI development and broader deployment.
