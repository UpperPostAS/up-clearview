## Critical Blockers ❌

These items MUST be completed before deployment:

### 1. IntakeScreen Form (❌ Not Built)
**Impact:** HIGH - Blocks intake workflow
**Status:** Screen displays requirements but has no data entry form
**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours
**Details:**
- Form2 is placeholder only
- No fields configured
- No save functionality
- No workflow logic

### 2. Household Members Section (❌ Not Built)
**Impact:** HIGH - Compliance and reporting requirement
**Status:** Placeholder exists on scrResidentAssociations, no functionality
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Details:**
- No Household Members list created
- No gallery or form built
- Cannot track household composition
- Affects HMIS reporting

### 3. Convert to Resident Testing (⚠️ Not Tested)
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Code complete but unvalidated
**Status:** Implementation done, needs end-to-end testing
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours validation
**Details:**
- All formulas appear correct
- Field types corrected during development
- Needs real data testing

---

## Minor Issues (Non-Blocking) ⚠️

### OnSuccess Handlers Missing
**Screens Affected:**
- RNAInfoScreen main form
- UnitInfoScreen Form1

**Impact:** Users don't get feedback when saves complete
**Workaround:** Forms do save correctly; refresh page to see updates
**Estimated Fix:** 1-2 hours total

### Service Provider Creation
**Issue:** Cannot add new provider from scrResidentAssociations
**Workaround:** Create providers in SharePoint, then select in app
**Impact:** Minor UX issue, functional workaround exists
**Estimated Fix:** 2-3 hours for inline creation

### Password Field Security
**Issue:** Account Information list has plain-text password field
**Recommendation:** Remove field, use browser password managers
**Impact:** Security concern
**Estimated Fix:** 1-2 hours

### Phone Screening Section
**Issue:** RNAInfoScreen phone screening has some issues
**Impact:** Main functionality works, edge cases need review
**Status:** Needs investigation and specific documentation
